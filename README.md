# About the Project:
This project was for my Scalable Databases course, in which I demonstrated the need for a centralized beauty review platform. I created a conceptual framework for a scalable relational database for this platform, and implemented a technical mockup of the database by integrating Python and MySQL.

# About Each File:
* **ConnectionScript_Public.py** contains the code for the project. Using MySQL Connector for Python, I integrated a MySQL database with Python by initializing the database in MySQL, and then utilizing this Python script to interact with and edit the database.
* **Beautyhive_Presentation.pdf** contains the final slide deck I presented in class.
* **BeautyHive_UML.pdf, BeautyHive_RelationalSchema.pdf, BeautyHive_ERDiagram.pdf** contain the UML diagram, relational schema, and entity-relationship diagram respectively.
